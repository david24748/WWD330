        This week number two, I remembered the basics of creating a function in JS, it is a bit difficult for me to understand these topics, however I saw extra videos on youtube that helped me understand the topic in a clearer way. I have learned everything I know about Javascript here at BYU Idaho and I feel that it is difficult for me to understand, however I am still studying some basics that I know will be useful to me.
        also this weekend I have to leave the city from Thursday and I have not received a response from my team I do not know if I can connect this week with them, however I was working on the group work on my own I studied some resources and in the end I compared it with the example, it turned out well, for the final challenge I did have to receive help from some colleagues but the example helped me a lot to understand how I could do it.
        something that made me curious and I asked myself why would I go to create an anonymous function? I looked for some videos on youtube and it said that it has its advantages when coding, however it is much better to create functions with specific names so that when a code is generated error to be able to find it more easily.
