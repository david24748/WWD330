        This week I have been able to download and prepare the materials for the class, the only thing missing is being able to access site point but it won't let me add to cart so I haven't been able to buy it. I already sent emails, I'm waiting for a response.
        As for this week's content, I saw the importance of being able to use localstorage by watching some videos on YouTube and also going to the class book "Doing Stuff with Web Things". I didn't know that book, but it seemed quite interesting to me.
        I was able to remember some principles of using HTML CSS AND JS, I also watched the videos provided in the class and they were quite helpful. I did the portfolio activity with JS however I didn't really understand the function of adding the link through JS to HTML. I searched on the internet about pivot tables and I found it very interesting, maybe I have to learn a little more about it to understand them.
