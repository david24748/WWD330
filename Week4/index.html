        well this week was a bit difficult, I think I processed a lot of information and I must work these next few weeks not to forget it,
        however every topic I read on SitePoint seemed very fundamental and important to me. Something that caught my attention is about 
        inheritance and polymorphism. they are very important parts when creating code because they allow us to save lines of repetitive 
        code and work with classes and methods in an efficient way.
        Also my group work was very interesting, my colleagues have very good knowledge and doing the group work made the work easier. 
        I was able to learn and solve questions that I had, the way of thinking of each person is very interesting, I find it very incredible 
        the way in which each one understands the code and does it in their own way, however, it helps a lot when working together.
