        This week was full of more important and interesting insights! Sitepoint has seemed to me a very interesting place to learn. There are topics this week that helped me form bases in JS that I wasn't very clear about before, I found the part about events on touch screens interesting, the topic of literal objects and methods was also a topic that I didn't have much about knowledge but through sitepoint I was able to learn a lot. This week I met with my work team and I felt very good with them, I feel that we learned together and mastered the topics more, the exercises were a bit difficult for us but we were able to do it by searching for resources on the internet and also reading specifically sitepoint. I liked the knowledge I learned this week and I feel that it is easier for me to understand constants and functions in JS and to store data and modify it.
